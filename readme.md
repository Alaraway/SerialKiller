# TODO: WRITE THIS??? 

## To install: 

Dependancies: 

Pip 
Python > 3.8

For linux use, the user needs access to the serial ports. This is done with:

> $ sudo adduser <your_username> dialout

check you are added to the group: 

> & groups 

Then, restart your computer. I could not get this to work without restarting my whole system. 

# To Run: 

With Python >= 3.8, run main.py from a terminal.  
The auto-installer *should* install dependancies if they don't exist.
