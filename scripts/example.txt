type each line
as if it were an input
you can write commands too!
like clearing the terminal
get ready...
#delay0
clear
extra info:
type "script -s" to save a script
type "script -o" to open one and run it 
type "script -scriptname" to open and run "scriptname" 
type "script" with no arguments to run whatever's in the script tab
the ESCAPE key will stop a script mid-execution
use #delay to modify the delay between lines
