l.write"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, "
l.write"dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell,"
l.write" nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on"
l.write" or to eat: it was a hobbit ­hole, and that means comfort. "
l.write"It had a perfectly round door like a porthole, painted green, "
l.write"with a shiny yellow brass knob in the exact middle. The door"
l.write" opened on to a tube ­shaped hall like a tunnel: a very comfortable"
l.write" tunnel without smoke, with panelled walls, and floors "
l.write"tiled and carpeted, provided with polished chairs, and lots and "
l.write"lots of pegs for hats and coats ­ the hobbit was fond of"
l.write" visitors. The tunnel wound on and on, going fairly bu"
l.write"t not quite straight into the side of the hill ­ The Hill, as all the"
l.write" people for many miles round called it ­ and many little round"
l.write"doors opened out of it, first on one side and then on another. "
l.write"No going upstairs for the hobbit: bedrooms, bathrooms, cellars,"
l.write" pantries (lots of these), wardrobes (he had whole rooms devoted to clothes),"
l.write" kitchens, dining­rooms, all were on the same floor, and indeed on the"
l.write" same passage. The best rooms were all on the left­hand side (going in), "
l.write"for these were the only ones to have windows, deep­set round windows"
l.write" looking over his garden and meadows beyond, sloping down to the river."
l.write" This hobbit was a very well­to­do hobbit, and his name was Baggins. "
l.write"The Bagginses had lived in the neighbourhood of The Hill for time out of mind,"
l.write" and people considered them very respectable, not only because most of "
l.write"them were rich, but also because they never had any adventures or did "
l.write"anything unexpected: you could tell what a Baggins would say on any "
l.write" question without the bother of asking him. This is a story of how a Baggins"
l.write" had an adventure, found himself doing and saying things altogether"
l.write" unexpected. He may have lost the neighbours' respect, but he gained­well,"
l.write" you will see whether he gained anything in the end."
